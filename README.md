StopGuess is a cutting-edge framework introducing a novel approach to cryptographic security through public-key authenticated Honey Encryption with Keyword Search (HEKS). This innovative framework integrates public-key authentication with Honey Encryption, a technique designed to confound brute-force attacks by generating plausible yet incorrect decryption results when an incorrect key is used. The incorporation of keyword search functionality further extends the utility of the system. The framework introduces a refined construction based on the combination of Honey Encryption with Equality Test and Non-Interactive Key Exchange. It establishes a mapping from plaintext to keys, providing an additional layer of defense against attackers attempting to guess the decryption key. The setup of public parameters, key pair generation, keyword encryption, trapdoor creation, and the testing of ciphertext equality. The framework's security is supported by correctness theorems, and instantiations using Diffie–Hellman NIKE and a pairing-based scheme are explored for flexibility. StopGuess not only offers a robust defense against brute-force attacks but also provides an efficient and secure solution for scenarios requiring keyword-based searches in encrypted data.

Proposed System
StopGuess introduces an innovative framework aimed at enhancing the security of cryptographic systems through a sophisticated combination of public-key authentication, honey encryption, and efficient keyword search functionalities. This proposed system addresses the vulnerabilities associated with brute-force attacks and unauthorized access attempts, providing a robust defense mechanism against malicious actors attempting to guess encryption keys. StopGuess incorporates a robust public-key authentication mechanism to ensure secure communication between parties. This involves the use of asymmetric key pairs for sender and receiver identities, bolstering the overall security posture of the system.
 The core of StopGuess lies in its integration of honey encryption, a cryptographic technique designed to deceive potential attackers attempting brute-force attacks. By generating plausible-looking but incorrect decryption results when an incorrect key is used, honey encryption adds a layer of confusion and complexity to the encryption process. StopGuess facilitates efficient keyword search capabilities, allowing authorized users to retrieve encrypted data related to specific keywords without compromising security. This feature is crucial for scenarios where quick and targeted access to encrypted information is necessary.
The system initiates by generating key pairs for both sender and receiver identities using a secure public-key infrastructure. This ensures that only authorized parties with the correct private keys can engage in secure communication.  StopGuess employs honey encryption to generate deceptive decryption results when an incorrect key is used. Legitimate decryption occurs only with the correct key, while incorrect keys yield decoy results, making it challenging for attackers to distinguish between the two. Authorized users can perform efficient keyword searches on encrypted data. The system allows for the retrieval of relevant information associated with specific keywords without compromising the overall security of the encryption scheme.  Secure communication is maintained through the use of public-key authentication. Only parties with the correct private keys can successfully decrypt and access the information, ensuring confidentiality and integrity.
The integration of honey encryption with public-key authentication significantly enhances the security of the system, especially against brute-force attacks.  StopGuess enables authorized users to selectively retrieve information based on keywords, ensuring targeted access without compromising the security of the overall encryption scheme.  The proposed system's flexibility makes it applicable to various cryptographic use cases, including secure communication, data storage, and information retrieval.
